        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            I will create a generative adversarial network to train two models.
            The first model will work to create works of art based on a given input and category.
            The second will be used to train the first, categorizing the artifically created artwork,
            and helping to adjust the first until it can create artwork that is highly likely to fall
            within a specific art discipline.
            <br>
            This project will require either finding or creating a dataset of paintings that fall
            within a particular artistic category. Then the creation of a classifier. This classifier
            will aid in determining the classification of the artwork.
            <br>
            The hope is to deploy the project such that allows the user to input a category and get an 
            original work of art relevent to that category back.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Create or find a categorically labeled artwork database.</li>
            <li>Train a classifier for these categories.</li>
            <li>Train a discriminator model that distinguish between categories and between real or fake art.</li>
            <li>Train a generator model that can create original images.</li>
        </ul>

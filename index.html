        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            I will create a generative adversarial network to train two models.
            The first model will work to create works of art based on a given input and category.
            The second will be used to train the first, categorizing the artifically created artwork,
            and helping to adjust the first until it can create artwork that is highly likely to fall
            within a specific art discipline.
            <br>
            This project will require either finding or creating a dataset of paintings that fall
            within a particular artistic category. Then the creation of a classifier. This classifier
            will aid in determining the classification of the artwork.
            <br>
            The hope is to deploy the project such that allows the user to input a category and get an 
            original work of art relevent to that category back.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Create or find a categorically labeled artwork database.</li>
            <li>Train a classifier for these categories.</li>
            <li>Train a discriminator model that distinguish between categories and between real or fake art.</li>
            <li>Train a generator model that can create original images.</li>

            <em>Introductory Paragraph:</em>
            Our work training this generative art model not only yields an artificial artist, 
            but gives insights into the potentially arbitrary nature by which society classifies artistic works 
            by displaying an understanding of various styles through its capacity for mimicry and 
            contextualization of content through its caption creation.
            <br><br>
            <em>Background Paragraph:</em>
            Generating realistic and unique images specifically from the input is difficult
            for the neural network to do, since it does not have a sense of what the work
            should look like, and it may take the shortcut of sticking to a singular output
            that happens to receive good feedback. 
            <br><br>
            <em>Transition Paragraph:</em>
            To overcome the difficulties discussed above, we plan to use multiple neural networks
            to train the output for realistic looking images. In addition, we will convert the output
            back to the input with a reverse process, which will ensure that solutions cannot be reused.
            <br><br>
            <em>Details Paragraph:</em>
            Our initial challenge was creating a dataset of images that appropriately aligned with each
             category such that we could properly develop our necessary GAN models, a discriminator model
            for classification/artificial art detection and a generator model for creation of properly classified
            art with a relevant name/caption.
            <br><br>
            <em>Assessment Paragraph:</em>
            Our model creates original works of art that, when judged by humans, were classified as the 
            appropriate style, and as expected, the captions associated with the works indicate an understanding
            of the content depicted in the work, showing there were in fact relevant consistencies 
            throughout the works in a given style.
            <br><br>
            <em>Ethics Discussion:</em>
            Ethically, we must consider the potential effects our project might have on the art community - 
            specifically - when new art can be generated in a matter of seconds. We will further this discussion
            in considering who the “real” artist is in a work produced by a neural network.

            <br>
            The GAN created by Ian Goodfellow was able to create original works of art, 
            even producing and printing the Portrait of Edmond Belamy in 2018.
            The GAN lets the discriminator model maximize the likelihood that real images “pass through”
            the model while synthetic ones don’t, and lets the generator minimize this likelihood.
            This process requires balancing the development of each model in order to have sustainable and realistic
            growth of either of them.

            </a></em>
            <br>
            The neural network described in this paper separates style and content and is able to combine
            the two to create new stylistic images. Style is interpreted through the texture in the painting,
            to prevent from the neural network interpreting style through the placement of objects in the artwork.
            In this paper, we see a discussion about balancing the content and the style of the artwork produced,
            to ensure that it is recognizable to the photograph and the style.

            <br>
            This paper discusses a method for training a neural network to translate images from one
            set to another without previously having labeled data. To do this, a mapping would need
            to be learned from the initial image to the new category, and then an inverse function
            would be used to evaluate that mapping. The loss function was computed between the
            original image and the original image created from the created image.

            This is an article written by an artist that uses neural networks to create some of her works.
            She gives descriptions about the different types of GANs that can be used, and why they are effective
            in different scenarios. All of these discussions pertain specifically to art, and address a bit of
            the philosophical questions we asked about who the artist is in this scenario.

            Software and Dataset
        </h4>
        <p>We will be using PyTorch, Jupyter Notebooks, and potentially CycleGAN to complete this project</p>
        <p>We will create the dataset with Python and APIs to scrape the web for images related to particular art choices</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <h4>
            The NN Design
        </h4>
        <p> We will be using a GAN consisting of a generator model and a discrimiator model. We will shrink our dataset to 256x256
            pixel images which we will pass in to the generator as 3-channel images with an additional "Desired category" input.
            The generator will be a Convolutional Neural Network and will similarly output a 3-channel image of the same dimensions. 
            This generator output, along with some of the art/training inputs will be passed into the discriminator, another Convolutional
            Neural Network. This discriminator model will output a vector of dimensions (n+1, 1) where n is the number of categories of art,
            and the +1 stands in for a "fake" category that does not fit in with the other artistic classifications.

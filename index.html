        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            I will create a generative adversarial network to train two models.
            The first model will work to create works of art based on a given input and category.
            The second will be used to train the first, categorizing the artifically created artwork,
            and helping to adjust the first until it can create artwork that is highly likely to fall
            within a specific art discipline.
            <br>
            This project will require either finding or creating a dataset of paintings that fall
            within a particular artistic category. Then the creation of a classifier. This classifier
            will aid in determining the classification of the artwork.
            <br>
            The hope is to deploy the project such that allows the user to input a category and get an 
            original work of art relevent to that category back.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Create or find a categorically labeled artwork database.</li>
            <li>Train a classifier for these categories.</li>
            <li>Train a discriminator model that distinguish between categories and between real or fake art.</li>
            <li>Train a generator model that can create original images.</li>
        </ul>

            <em>Introductory Paragraph:</em>
            Our work training this generative art model not only yields an artificial artist, 
            but gives insights into the potentially arbitrary nature by which society classifies artistic works 
            by displaying an understanding of various styles through its capacity for mimicry and 
            contextualization of content through its caption creation.
            <br>
            <em>Background Paragraph:</em>
            Generating realistic and unique images specifically from the input is difficult
            for the neural network to do, since it does not have a sense of what the work
            should look like, and it may take the shortcut of sticking to a singular output
            that happens to receive good feedback. 
            <br>
            Transition Paragraph:
            To overcome the difficulties discussed above, we plan to use multiple neural networks
            to train the output for realistic looking images. In addition, we will convert the output
            back to the input with a reverse process, which will ensure that solutions cannot be reused.
            <br>
            <em>Details Paragraph:</em>
            Our initial challenge was creating a dataset of images that appropriately aligned with each
             category such that we could properly develop our necessary GAN models, a discriminator model
            for classification/artificial art detection and a generator model for creation of properly classified
            art with a relevant name/caption.
            <br>
            <em>Assessment Paragraph:</em>
            Our model creates original works of art that, when judged by humans, were classified as the 
            appropriate style, and as expected, the captions associated with the works indicate an understanding
            of the content depicted in the work, showing there were in fact relevant consistencies 
            throughout the works in a given style.
            <br>
            <em>Ethics Discussion:</em>
            Ethically, we must consider the potential effects our project might have on the art community - 
            specifically - when new art can be generated in a matter of seconds. We will further this discussion
            in considering who the “real” artist is in a work produced by a neural network.
